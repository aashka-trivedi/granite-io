All of the data that you provide to Git Repos and Issue Tracking, including but not limited to source files, issues, pull requests, and project configuration properties, is managed securely within Continuous Delivery. However, Git Repos and Issue Tracking supports various mechanisms for exporting, sending, or otherwise sharing data to users and third parties. The ability of Git Repos and Issue Tracking to share information is typical of many social coding platforms. However, such sharing might conflict with regulatory controls that apply to your business. After you create a project in Git Repos and Issue Tracking, but before you entrust any files, issues, records, or other data with the project, review the project settings and change any settings that you deem necessary to protect your data. Settings to review include visibility levels, email notifications, integrations, web hooks, access tokens, deploy tokens, and deploy keys. Project visibility levels \\n\\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking projects can have one of the following visibility levels: private, internal, or public. * Private projects are visible only to project members. This setting is the default visibility level for new projects, and is the most secure visibility level for your data. * Internal projects are visible to all users that are logged in to IBM Cloud. * Public projects are visible to anyone. To limit project access to only project members, complete the following steps:\\n\\n\\n\\n1. From the project sidebar, click Settings > General. 2.

If you are a Git Repos and Issue Tracking project Maintainer or Owner, you can invite any user and group members to the project.

Project email settings \\n\\nBy default, Git Repos and Issue Tracking notifies project members by way of email about project activities. These emails typically include customer-owned data that was provided to Git Repos and Issue Tracking by users. For example, if a user posts a comment to an issue, Git Repos and Issue Tracking sends an email to all subscribers. The email includes information such as a copy of the comment, the user who posted it, and when the comment was posted. To turn off all email notifications for your project, complete the following steps:\\n\\n\\n\\n1. From the project sidebar, click Settings > General. 2.
